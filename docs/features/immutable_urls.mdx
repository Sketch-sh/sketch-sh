# Immutable URLs

Each sketch has a unique and immutable url.
It means the content of each URL never changes.
This is extremely useful for archive or storage because context won't be lost
because the URL was updated.

## How?

Below is the breakdown of each sketches url:

### Basics

```sh
/s/__SKETCH_COMMIT_UUID__
```

This URL is immutable. Every time you hit save, you'll a new URL.
But that'd be annoying right?

### Signed in users

Don't worry, we got you covered. When signed in, you can create pretty URLs that is linked
to your user name like this one:

```sh
/u/thangngoc89/my-awesome-article__SKETCH_UUID__
```

You can share that URL and it will be redirected to the latest commit:

```sh
/u/thangngoc89/my-awesome-article__SKETCH_UUID__/__SKETCH_COMMIT_UUID__
```

Granted it won't help with "losing context" but you can see all the commits of a sketch
along with the created time of each commit. That won't be accurate but enough to help you
firgure out the context of the conversation.

### Anonymous users

Because anonymous users can't update anything in the database, you can't create pretty URLs.
Please login to create pretty URLs.

## Technical benefits of immutable URLs

Because we don't analyze sketch's content server side, we can potentially move content storage
to a cheaper storage solution like AWS S3 and 
keep the main Postgres database small and fast for metadata.
